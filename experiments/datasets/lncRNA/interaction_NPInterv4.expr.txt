ncRI-40000001	4.5S	NONOTHNOBEDT000074	lncRNA	rpoD	P0A6M8	protein	Following translocation, 4.5S RNA replaces 23S rRNA as a binding site for EF-G. This replacement promotes the dissociation of EF-G from the ribosome. GDP has positive effects on the RNA binding.The conserved decanucleotide sequence (5-GAAGCAGCCA-3) of 4.5S RNA, competed with the 23S rRNA region defining the EF-G-binding site.

Both OxyS and DsrA could compete with each other for binding to Hfq in vitro, it is likely that DsrA also binds to Hfq in vivo. Hfq acts as a protein cofactor for the regulatory activities of DsrA by either altering the structure of DsrA or forming an active RNA-Protein complex. In addition, in the absence of Hfq, chromosome-expressed DsrA was unstable, while plasmid-expressed DsrA remained stable.

ncRI-40007417	ssrA	NONOTHNOBEDT001066	lncRNA	smpB	B1IVL4	protein	SmpB protein binds to SsrA RNA in vitro with an affinity (20 nM) that would ensure substantial binding at the concentrations of SsrA that have been measured in vivo. SmpB protein is required for efficient SsrA-mediated tagging of proteins synthesized from mRNAs that lack in-frame termination codons, and directly or indirectly facilitates the stable association of SsrA RNA with 70S ribosomes.
